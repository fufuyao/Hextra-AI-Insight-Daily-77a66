```

### Product & Feature Updates
1.  Ant Digital recently launched a game-changing **multilingual visual large model training framework**. This innovative framework aims to conquer the "communication barriers" of low-resource languages, truly enabling AI to achieve global coverage 🌍. Thanks to its unique "target language thinking" mechanism, the framework has delivered outstanding performance in multiple benchmark tests, even surpassing **GPT-4o** in certain tasks, effectively achieving a "dimension reduction" in low-resource language processing. This technology is already being utilized in ZOLOZ's [document recognition products (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/22513), providing robust technical support for global operations.

2.  ByteDance's AI service platform, **TRAE**, recently announced the official delisting of all **Claude series models** due to policy adjustments by its supplier, Anthropic. This move stems from Anthropic's decision to stop providing model services to companies with Chinese investment backgrounds, causing significant ripples within the domestic developer community that relies on its technology. While users can still access other models, this situation undoubtedly serves as a wake-up call for the rise of domestic large models, leaving a notable market void 📉.

### Frontier Research
1.  Tired of those easily identifiable "AI faces"? **FLUX.1 Krea [dev]**, the open-source image generation model from Krea AI and Black Forest Labs, is here to totally eliminate that "plastic feel." This model innovatively employs a two-stage training method, "learn broadly, then specialize," using **SFT** and their self-developed **TPO** (an RLHF technique) for aesthetic fine-tuning. This ensures generated images shed their stiffness and exude a natural artistic flair. If you're curious to experience [the "de-AI-fying" magic (AI News)](https://www.krea.ai/blog/flux-krea-open-source-release#starting-with-a-raw-base) firsthand, check out their impressive results ✨.
    `![AI News: Unnatural traces in AI-generated images](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/11/news_01k97qzxfxfe0rm21sr11qjsce.avif)![](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/11/news_01k97r0cgaeksbkqj6xv473mkd.avif)`

2.  A new study reveals that the current field of **AI gesture generation** is stuck in a self-congratulatory loop, lacking unified and scientific evaluation standards. This leads to various models boasting their own merits, with no clear indication of who the true champion is. To address this, researchers have introduced a standardized human evaluation protocol based on the **BEAT2** dataset, conducting large-scale crowdsourced tests on six recent models. The results uncover a harsh truth: newer models aren't always superior, and the entire field desperately needs an impartial "referee" ⚖️ to genuinely advance. You can [read this paper (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01233) for more details.

3.  A technical report on **SAIL-Embedding** offers an impressive answer to the question of how AI can understand all things and establish connections between them. This report details the construction of an all-encompassing **Omni-modal** embedding foundation model, a true "Rosetta Stone" for the AI world. Through multi-stage training, this model can process data from various modalities and inject powerful "collaborative perception" capabilities into recommendation systems, making recommendations feel like they truly understand you. These [research findings (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12709) have already demonstrated significant results in real-world scenarios like TikTok, proving its immense potential 💪!

4.  The **TaylorIR** framework is giving AI a serious upgrade for image super-resolution. While traditional Transformer models often see the world through "thick glasses," always a bit blurry when handling this task, TaylorIR acts like "contact lenses" for AI. It employs **1x1** pixel-level patch embedding and an innovative **TaylorShift** attention mechanism, achieving truly refined inference. This not only elevates image reconstruction quality to a new SOTA level but also reduces memory consumption by a whopping 60%, perfectly resolving the conflict between high-definition detail and computational efficiency. Friends [interested in this technological breakthrough (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10231) can dive deeper into this skyrocketing performance 🚀.

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

2.  Japan's animation titan, **Studio Ghibli**, along with several other content creators, has issued an ultimatum to OpenAI, demanding it cease the unauthorized use of copyrighted material to train AI models. The trigger for this incident was the ease with which tools like Sora could generate "Ghibli-style" images and videos. Even OpenAI's CEO was reportedly seen using such avatars, a classic case of "official memeing gone too far." CODA (Content Overseas Distribution Association, Japan) emphasizes that this "act first, ask questions later" model could constitute infringement in Japan, further fueling the global [AI copyright dispute (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/22479) 🔥.

8.  Despite enterprises pouring hundreds of billions into generative AI, a whopping 95% of organizations haven't seen any financial returns – this is what's being dubbed the "**productivity paradox**." This article thoroughly dissects this phenomenon, using historical general-purpose technologies like the steam engine, electricity, and computers as examples. It highlights that the widespread adoption of disruptive technologies and subsequent productivity boosts require a lengthy "J-curve" process. AI's true explosion might still be waiting for the maturity of infrastructure, skills, and complementary products. To grasp [this profound insight (AI News)](https://ybzavo65ti.feishu.cn/wiki/YWHYwC87Ai3H1Sk7R13cazmPnob), this article is an absolute must-read 📚.
