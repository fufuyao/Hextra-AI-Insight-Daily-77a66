## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't meant for anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable info from anyone under 13.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might contain links to other websites that aren't operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you'll be whisked away 🚀 to that third party's site. We totally recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.
