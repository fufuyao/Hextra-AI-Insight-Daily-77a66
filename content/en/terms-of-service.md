# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to here as "the Site" or "we")! 🎉 Before you dive into using our services, please take a moment to read through these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're basically saying, "Yep, I agree to all this!"

## 1. Service Overview
The Site offers users a bunch of paid subscription content and member services. Think blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and even community interaction – and that's just scratching the surface! 🤩 Just a heads-up, though, some content is only for our awesome subscribers.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
*   Users need to sign up for an account by providing a valid email address and setting a password. Easy peasy!
*   Users are responsible for keeping their account secure and for all activities happening under it. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing** your account – that's a big no-no! 🙅‍♀️
*   The Site reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they break these terms. Don't say we didn't warn ya! 😉

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   Subscription services are billed on a monthly or annual basis, with costs clearly laid out on the checkout page. No hidden surprises here! 💸
*   All payments are processed securely through third-party platforms like Stripe or PayPal. We don't store your payment info on our end, so you can breathe easy. 🔒
*   Subscriptions will **automatically renew** unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends. Keep an eye on that calendar!
*   **Our 14-day refund policy** is pretty sweet: if you're a first-time subscriber and not totally stoked with our service within 14 days of purchase, you can snag a full refund. Just hit us up via the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why you're bouncing. Each user gets one shot at this refund, so use it wisely! After 14 days, or if it's not your first rodeo with us, payments are generally **non-refundable**, unless the law absolutely says otherwise. Fair's fair, right?

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
*   All original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. That means you can't just copy, repost, or use it for commercial purposes without our say-so. Play nice! 😉
*   Users only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right** to access content for personal learning and reading. It's for your eyes only, basically.
*   For commercial use or if you want to quote a lot, please hit up the Site to get authorization. Let's chat first! 🤝

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   Users are strictly prohibited from uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights. Keep it clean, folks! 🚫
*   Users are strictly prohibited from using technical means to bulk download, crawl, or crack member-only content. That's just sneaky, and we're watching! 👀
*   The Site has the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban rule-breaking users**. Seriously, don't test us! 🙅‍♂️

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   We reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate all or part of our services at any time, without prior notice. Think of it as keeping things fresh! ✨
*   The Site **won't be liable for compensation** if content is temporarily unavailable due to force majeure, server issues, or third-party service interruptions. Sometimes things are just outta our hands, ya know?

## 7. Disclaimer
*   The information provided by the Site is for reference only and **does not constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff). We're not pros in those areas, so don't take it as gospel! 🧐
*   The Site **is not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users incur from using our content or services. Basically, use at your own risk! 🤷‍♀️

## 8. Governing Law
*   These Terms of Service are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. Just keeping things official! 📜
*   Any disputes arising from or related to these Terms should first be sorted out amicably between both parties. If a friendly chat doesn't do the trick, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Let's try to be friends first, though! 🙏
