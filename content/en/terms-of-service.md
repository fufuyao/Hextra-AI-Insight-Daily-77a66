# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (aka "the Site" or "we")! Before you dive into our services, please give these Terms of Service a good read. Seriously, by just visiting or using our Site, you're cool with and accepting these terms. 😉

## 1. Service Overview

**The Site** hooks users up with paid subscription content and exclusive member services. Think blog posts, special resources, e-books, and sweet community vibes – that kind of stuff! Just a heads-up, some of our juiciest content is exclusively for our subscribed members. ✨

## 2. User Registration & Accounts

- **Users** gotta provide a valid email address and set a password to get their account registered. Easy peasy! 📧
- **Users** are totally on the hook for their account's security and everything that happens on it. And listen up: **NO transferring or sharing your account**, ever. That's a big no-no! 🚫
- **The Site** can, if you break these terms, **pause or even terminate** your account. Just keeping things fair!

## 3. Paid Subscription Services

- **Subscription services** are usually billed monthly or annually, and you'll see all the deets about the fees clearly laid out on the checkout page. No surprises!
- **All payments** zoom through awesome third-party payment platforms (think Stripe, PayPal, etc.). We totally get it: **the Site** doesn't store your payment info, keeping things super secure! 🔒
- Heads up: your **subscription will automatically renew** unless you cancel it before your current billing cycle wraps up. So, if you want out, make sure to do it in time! 🔄
- **Our 14-day Refund Policy** is here to make sure you're happy! If you're a first-time subscriber and our service isn't quite hitting the mark within 14 days of your purchase, you can totally ask for a full refund. Just shoot us an email at the contact address at the end of these terms and tell us what's up. Quick note: each user gets only one refund chance. If it's past 14 days or you're not a first-timer, then unless the law absolutely forces our hand, **no refunds** after payment. We think that's pretty fair! 💸

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property

- **All original content's copyright belongs to the Site (hubtoday)**, plain and simple! So, no copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial stuff without getting our permission first, okay? 🧐
- **Users** get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access** pass, strictly for your personal learning and reading pleasure. Keep it to yourself, please! 📚
- Got plans for **commercial use or need to quote us extensively**? Sweet! Just hit up **the Site** to get our authorization first. We're usually pretty friendly! 😉

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines

- **Uploading, publishing, or spreading** any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or just plain infringing on others' rights? Yeah, that's a hard **NO**. Don't do it! 🙅‍♀️
- **Bulk downloading, scraping, or trying to crack open our member-only content with technical wizardry**? That's a definite **NO-GO**. We're watching! 👀
- **The Site** totally reserves the right to yank any inappropriate content and **give violating users the boot**. Play nice, folks! 👋

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions

- **We** totally reserve the right to change, hit pause on, or even pull the plug on any part of our services (or all of 'em!) whenever we need to, without giving you a heads-up. That's just how the tech world rolls sometimes! 🤷‍♂️
- If something big like force majeure, a server glitch, or a third-party service going down makes our content temporarily unavailable, **the Site** **won't be on the hook for any compensation**. Bummer, we know! 😞

## 7. Disclaimer

- **The info we dish out on the Site**? It's just for reference, folks! It **doesn't count** as any kind of professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff). So, don't take it as gospel! 😉
- And hey, for any direct or indirect losses you might rack up from using our content or services, **the Site** **takes zero responsibility**. Just setting expectations! 🤷‍♀️

## 8. Governing Law

- **These Terms of Service** are gonna be governed by and interpreted according to the laws of sunny California, USA. We're skipping any conflict of laws principles here! 📜
- For **any beef or issues popping up from or related to these terms**, we should totally try to sort it out friendly-like first. If we can't hug it out, you agree to take it to the courts with jurisdiction in Santa Clara County, California. Fair's fair! ⚖️
